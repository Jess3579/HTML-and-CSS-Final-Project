                    <img src="media/Coq-au-vin.jpg" alt="Coq au Vin" style="margin-bottom: -10px;">
                    <h4>Photo by Ewan Munro from London, UK <br>

                    <p><strong>Coq au Vin</strong> is a classic French dish whose name literally translates to 'rooster in wine'. It’s made by slow-cooking chicken on the bone with wine, mushrooms, salty pork or bacon, mushrooms, onions, and sometimes garlic.</p>
                    <h4>Recipe</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>6 chicken thighs, bone in</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 cups red wine (preferably Burgundy)</li>
                        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
                        <li>8 ounces bacon, cut into small strips</li>
                        <li>10 large mushrooms, sliced</li>
                        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                        <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
                        <li>Herbs: bay leaf, thyme, salt, and pepper</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Combine all ingredients in a large pot, bring to a boil, and simmer for about 2 hours until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened.</p>
                    <h4>History of Coq au Vin</h4>
                    <p>The history of <strong>Coq au Vin</strong> is not completely clear, but it is believed to have been around since ancient Gaul and Roman times. The method of marinating meat in wine was likely developed to tenderize tough meats. This dish became popularized in France as a way to cook rooster, an otherwise tough and less desirable meat. Over the centuries, it has evolved into a beloved staple of French cuisine, showcasing the country's rich culinary tradition and love of wine.</p>

                <h2>Language Spotlight: Hebrew</h2>
                <p>This month, the spotlight is on Hebrew, an ancient language that has been revived in the modern era as the official language of Israel. From its biblical roots to its use in daily Israeli life, Hebrew is a language with rich history and significance.</p>
                
                <article>
                    <h3>About Hebrew</h3>
                    <p>Hebrew was historically a spoken language in ancient times before falling out of common use as a daily spoken language. Revived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda among others, it has transformed into the everyday language of millions of people in Israel and Jewish communities worldwide.</p>
            
                    <h3>Basic Phrases in Hebrew</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hello: שלום (Shalom)</li>
                        <li>Thank you: תודה (Todah)</li>
                        <li>Goodbye: להתראות (Lehitra'ot)</li>
                        <li>Please: בבקשה (Bevakasha)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
                    <p>Hebrew is not just a means of communication, but a vital link to Jewish history and religion. It is the language of the Torah, and it plays a crucial role in Jewish religious practices and cultural life.</p>
